Nikita Kuznetsov is passionate about adaptive user interfaces & intuitive user experiences and loves building web applications.

He was destined to be an engineer even in childhool, when he played with LEGOs practically non-stop (well past the acceptable age for a kid to still be playing with LEGOs).

As a teenager, he taught himself to build simple websites using HTML+CSS, adding interactivity with Flash. (Yes. Flash).

After graduating university in 2010, he took on web applications as a profession, and worked on drag-and-drop games for an educational startup, customer loyalty apps for a marketing startup, dynamic consumer funnels and dashboards for an energy startup, data application monitoring tools for a data startup, and a graphical chat app for a collaboration startup.
